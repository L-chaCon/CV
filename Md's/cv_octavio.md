## Summary
As a Data Migration Specialist and Software Developer, I specialize in Python scripting. At ArtLogic, I pioneered a Python tool for seamless data migration, implemented CI/CD pipelines, and automated developer environment setup, significantly enhancing team efficiency. In Independencia Ciudadana, I led a team in developing a data aggregation platform, refactoring applications, and implementing CI/CD pipelines. With experience in Python, Ansible, Docker, and AWS, I have delivered solutions to software development projects. My background in Civil Engineering underscores my multidisciplinary problem-solving approach. Fluent in English and Spanish, I offer both technical expertise and effective communication skills to software development teams.
## Work Experience
### **Data Migration Specialist, ArtLogic** - Full-time, London, UK (**Mar 2022 - Present**)
Working in a team at the largest art gallery manager software, I specialized in **Python scripting**, customizing scripts to meet the client's needs.  Regular communication with project managers ensures precise customization based on their needs for each gallery project. 
- Developed a tailored **Python tool** for seamless data migration, efficiently **transforming non-relational databases (MongoDB) to relational databases (MySQL)**,  thereby expanding the company's capability to import data from diverse sources.
- Pioneered the implementation of **Continuous Integration (CI)** for our internal library, introducing the first **unit testing**. Additionally, I developed **bash scripts** integrated into **GitLab pipelines**, which have **significantly saved developers time** by identifying and rectifying bugs prior to committing code changes.
- Developed an **Ansible script** to automate the setup of the developer environment within our team, drastically **reducing onboarding time to just a day**. This initiative has also expedited and streamlined team migrations to upgraded environments, ensuring faster and smoother transitions for all members.
