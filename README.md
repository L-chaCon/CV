## Summary
As a Software Developer with expertise in Python, Ansible, Docker, and AWS, I have successfully delivered solutions across various software development projects. My background in Civil Engineering underscores my multidisciplinary problem-solving approach. Fluent in English and Spanish, I offer both technical expertise and effective communication skills to software development teams.
## Work Experience
### **Python Developer, ArtLogic** - Full-time, London, UK (**Mar 2022 - Present**)
I am working in a team at the largest art gallery manager software company, I specialise in **Python scripting**, customising scripts to meet the client’s needs.
- Developed an **Ansible script** to automate the setup of the developer environment within our team, drastically **reducing onboarding time to just a day**. This initiative has also expedited and streamlined team migrations to upgraded environments, ensuring faster and smoother transitions for all members.
- Developed a customised **Python tool** for seamless data migration, efficiently **transforming non-relational databases (MongoDB) into relational databases (MySQL)**, enabling the smooth migration of over 30 new clients in the past year.
- Pioneered the implementation of **Continuous Integration (CI)** for our internal library, introducing the first **unit testing**. Additionally, I developed **bash scripts** integrated into **GitLab pipelines**, which have **significantly saved developers time** by identifying and rectifying bugs before committing code changes.
### **Software Developer, Independencia Ciudadana** - Freelance, Santiago, Chile (**Sep 2022 - Mar 2024**)
I led a team of developers in the development and deployment of a data aggregation platform for a Chilean borough.
- **Managed a team of developers**,line-managing and overseeing their progress 
- Spearheaded the **setup and integration of Azure products**, leading the partnership with an external company to ensure seamless implementation.
- Led the refactoring of a **Django** application to **Django Rest Framework** and **Angular**, transitioning from a **monolithic to a service-oriented design**, enhancing modularity and independence for future teams.
- **Implemented CI/CD pipelines** for streamlined Angular application deployment, improving efficiency and reliability.
- Delivered a functional prototype featuring a dynamic dashboard, showcasing borough data for informed decision-making.
### **Django Developer, Independencia Ciudadana** - Full-time, Santiago, Chile (**Jan 2021 - Dic 2021**)
I developed the data architecture for a local council in Santiago, from form collection to transformation, storage and visualisation.
- Managed the development cycle from project scoping to development and deployment
- Connected **Django with AWS services**.
- Implemented agile methodologies using Miro and Notion to enhance team collaboration and project management.
- Increased efficiency of workers in the council by facilitating an interface that saved time in administration protocols to a third of the time.
